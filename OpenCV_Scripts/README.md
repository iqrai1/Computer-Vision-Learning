# Computer Vision Learning Repository

Welcome to my Computer Vision Learning Repository! This project is a reflection of my daily progress as I learn and experiment with computer vision concepts using Python. Each script and notebook focuses on a different topic, covering the essential aspects of image processing and computer vision.

## ðŸš€ Repository Goals
The primary goal of this repository is to help me document my journey while also offering useful examples and resources for others interested in learning computer vision. Over time, this repository will grow to cover advanced topics in computer vision and image analysis.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered So Far:
- **OpenCV Basics**: Loading and displaying images, image resizing, etc.
- **Color Spaces**: Conversion between different color spaces (BGR, RGB, HSV, etc.).
- **Edge Detection**: Detecting edges using Canny and Sobel filters.
- **Contour Detection**: Finding and drawing contours on images.
- **Blurring and Smoothing**: Techniques to blur and smooth images.
- **Thresholding**: Global and adaptive thresholding methods.

## ðŸ”§ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project and run the scripts:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iqrai1/Computer-Vision-Learning.git
